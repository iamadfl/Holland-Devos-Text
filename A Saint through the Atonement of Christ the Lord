In general conference of October 2016, I told the
story of my friends Troy and Deedra Russell of
the Dutchman Pass Ward in Henderson, Nevada.
No one will remember the talk, but it dealt with
their experience when Troy pulled his pickup
truck out of the garage on his way to donate goods
to the local Deseret Industries. As he did so, he felt
his back tire roll over a bump. Thinking some item
had fallen off the truck, he got out only to find
his precious nine-year-old son, Austen, lying face
down on the pavement. The screams, the priesthood blessing, the paramedic crew, the hospital
staff—all, in due course, were engaged in trying
to save this beautiful boy’s life, but to no avail.
Austen was gone.
Over time, Troy and Deedra found peace in
their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, in the comforting presence of the Holy Ghost, and in the
scores of loving friends and neighbors who
helped them, especially their then “home teacher”
John Manning.
My purpose today is not to repeat that message
but to tell you in your university years that some
of life’s lessons will be difficult, and you may be
asked to face more than you think you can—and
certainly more than you want.
In Brother and Sister Russell’s case, one might
think that losing a child in the nightmarish
way that they lost Austen would be enough of
a parental test for any young couple to face. But
there is language in the very heart of one of the
greatest of all Book of Mormon sermons that
implies trials and tests may come to us often
in life. In his farewell address, King Benjamin
taught that a fundamental purpose of mortal
life—perhaps the fundamental purpose—is to
become “a saint through the atonement of Christ
the Lord,” which will require us to become “as
a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full
of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord
seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth
submit to his father."
What does that mean for us? It means that
struggle and strife, heartbreak and loss, are not
experiences that come only somewhere else to
someone else. It means that moments in which
faith feels frightfully difficult to hold on to are not
reserved for our bygone days of persecution and
martyrdom. No, the times when becoming a saint
through Christ the Lord seems almost—almost—
too much to achieve are still with us. And so it
will be until God has proven His people for their
eternal reward. We will be asked to submit, to
obey, and to be childlike. For some of us that is
difficult now, and it will be difficult then.
My plea today, in this university that I love
with all my heart, is that we practice now and be
strong now for those times of affliction and refinement that surely will come. For some of us they
come now, in university years. That is when faith
in God, faith in Christ, and faith in The Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will really count.
That is when faith must be unwavering, because
it will be examined in the refiner’s fire to see if
it is more than “sounding brass, or a tinkling
cymbal.” For some, the severity of the test might
seem like a marathon-length final exam in Mortal
Life 101. It is then, sailing in what Hamlet called
“a sea of troubles,” that it may take all the faith
you have just to keep your little craft afloat.
But you can sail on, King Benjamin said, if you
will be childlike, “submissive, meek, humble, full of love.” I think the only commentary
needed for this verse might be regarding the line
suggesting God “inflicts” trials and burdens upon
us. In English, the word inflict, which comes from
the Latin infligere, has at least two meanings. One
is “to strike or dash against” and another is “to
beat down,” but those definitions are not applicable to God or His angels. No, the proper definition of the word as King Benjamin used it is to
allow “something that must be borne or suffered.”
Now allowing something is a different matter! God
can and will do that if it is ultimately for our good.
I am going to say it again: God does not now nor
will He ever do to you a destructive, malicious,
unfair thing—ever. It is not in what Peter called
“the divine nature” to even be able to do so. By
definition and in fact, God is perfectly and thoroughly, always and forever good, and everything He
does is for our good. I promise you that God does
not lie awake nights trying to figure out ways to
disappoint us or harm us or crush our dreams or
our faith.
Now, with that long introduction, let’s return
to Troy and Deedra Russell just four months ago.
Early in the morning hours of September 8, having
spent much of the night getting her second son
ready for his beginnings at BYU–Idaho, Deedra
Russell was traveling northbound on Interstate 15.
Near mile marker number 14, where the highway
is tightly cut into the sides of the Virgin River
Gorge, Deedra saw a pickup truck traveling at
freeway speed. Unfortunately, it was traveling
right at her, coming south in her northbound lane.
At the wheel was an inebriated male driver, age
thirty-nine.
This is a photo taken by emergency personnel
at about 5:30 in the morning, so forgive the dark
lighting. It is what was left of Deedra’s charcoalcolored Honda after the head-on collision. [A
photo of the wrecked car was shown.]
In spite of what that wreckage would seem to
indicate, Sister Russell, though pinned immovably
inside the car, was not killed in this accident. With
remarkable assistance from emergency personnel,
she was extricated from the wreckage and lifeflighted to the St. George Regional Medical Center,
where—after 132 days of hospitalization, some
forty of them in intensive care—she is still waging
the fight of her life.
Fortunately, she is alive.
Here is the best she could do to say goodbye to
her oldest son, Collin, who left two months after
the accident to serve in the Canada Edmonton
Mission, Tagalog speaking. Her dreams of helping him get ready and
seeing him off to serve were left somewhere near
mile marker number 14 on Interstate 15.
I need to move past the details of Deedra’s
medical condition, but, as I do, let me say that her
lacerations, fractures, and surgical needs almost
defied description. She has been in the operating
room for eighteen surgeries, with more to come.
Her kidneys have been damaged, and at least two
of her external wounds have to remain open with
wound VAC assistance until they can be closed.
Indescribable pain, interrelated injuries, recurring nightmares, and, most recently, a sequence of
paralytic seizures have been her lot day and night.
But every indication is that she is going to make it,
for which we are grateful.
Here is a photo of Deedra with Troy on the
right and Area Seventy Jonathan S. Schmitt on
the left, to whom I am indebted for many of the
photos.
Heaven’s Grace Exceeds Our Merit
Now let me share a few gospel-related thoughts
I have had as these reports have come in.

Lesson 1

First of all, public condemnation of the driver—
who miraculously survived this incident and is
with his parents and some of the Russell family
in the audience today as our special guests—is
not the purpose of this message. Our purpose is
to learn. And that is why we come to a university.
And one thing this brother and his family have
taught us is that when we have made a mistake,
serious or otherwise, we should feel genuine
remorse and sorrow, and we should take responsibility for damage done and suffering caused.
In the process, we should demand of ourselves a
change in the habits and behaviors that brought
on these harmful events. But even when we have
done what we can, it often won’t amount to much,
so we will have to ask God to carry all the parts
we can’t repair or repay. To deserve such help, we
surely ought to seek to live a life that would warrant it, always remembering that heaven’s grace
exceeds our merit. I am touched that the brother
who caused this accident is trying to do all that I
have just said in every way he knows how.
For example, I was touched to learn that in
addition to his writing to, praying for, and visiting Deedra and Troy, he and his extended family
spent not a penny on Christmas gifts this year in
order to give that sizeable cash equivalent to the
Russells to help defray some of the horrendous
financial costs that will most assuredly bankrupt
them before this is all over.
An equally poignant example of true remorse is
this handwritten eight-page letter, a copy of which
I hold in my hand. It is too long to read here in its
entirety, but I give you just a sample line or two:
Deedra, I feel so horrible [about what] I [have
done] to you. My heart is [broken]. My lungs can’t
breathe. I am so sorry for the pain you are in. . . .
Troy, you are an angel [to forgive me]. . . . I am
so sorry you had to go through so much in your lives
already, and now this, all because of me. . . . [But] I
am going to church again. I am reading my scriptures
every night.
And please tell the kids I am so sorry I hurt their
mother. I know I nearly took your life, but if
it matters, you have saved mine.
Sincerely, . . .
Behind what we want to be a hopeful and
constructive ending to this story is the constant
reminder, the drumbeat in our brain—rain or
shine, night or day, spring, summer, winter, and
fall—that says there is a loving reason to obey
gospel laws and a worthy reason to follow gospel
principles, that the keeping of God’s commandments really is important, and that revealed do’s
and don’ts are for a purpose.
Without needing another photo of that Honda
to prompt us, we all ought to recognize the wisdom of a loving God who—decades before cars
and freeways and life flights were ever imagined—
revealed the destructive possibilities of alcohol
consumption. Without listing again the crushing
costs borne by the victim and the perpetrator of
this accident, we ought to acknowledge the tears of
a Heavenly Father who simply asks us to take care
of one another, to be careful rather than reckless
with the well-being of our sisters and our brothers.
Childlike obedience to His parental calls and His
divine warnings will spare us and others agony in
the end. Thus the cry of His Only Begotten Son: “If
ye love me, keep my commandments.” It is part of
the apostolic burden for us to stand with the Savior
with that plea, in that request. We always extend
our love—always—but we are morally obligated
to ask for obedience to the commandments as evidence of that affection.
Now, please, please, as I have tried to speak
of childlike, Christlike, saintly submission to
the trials and tribulations of life and to divine
commandments, however tried and tested you
may already feel, please do not walk out of here
today eager to tell your absentee roommate that
Elder Holland gave a devotional today on the
Word of Wisdom. If you want to see an old man
cry, do that! I pray you will find my message
larger and more significant than the sorrow of
drunk driving.

Lesson 2

After understanding the reason for commandments and the need to seek forgiveness when we
break them, I offer a second lesson. It is the other
side of the forgiveness coin: Just as the transgressor seeks forgiveness as part of the quest for relief
and peace, we need to forgive at least in part
for the relief and peace it brings us. As angry as
Troy and Deedra might justifiably have been over
this terrible experience, they have felt that they
should not withhold forgiveness for him who
gave offense. At least part of that motivation was
because Troy has spent these last five years of his
life struggling with his role, accidental as it was, in
the loss of nine-year-old Austen.
To carry that into this setting, there is not
one of us anywhere on this campus who has not
needed forgiveness for some mistake made. Our
deed may not have been as severe as the kind
we are recounting today, but we have all made
mistakes, and some of them were very serious mistakes. Whatever the event, we all thank God for
being the Father of forgiveness and for the gifts of
mercy and relief He offers us—all of it ultimately
coming to us through the majestic Atonement
of His Only Begotten Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.
We are to join in and participate in that offering.
The Russells have done that. They have looked
up to their God and, even in their anguish, have
humbly but resolutely joined the Savior in extending forgiveness to one in need. Surely they have
been “submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of
love.” Without embarrassing them, surely they
are becoming “saint[s] through the atonement of
Christ the Lord.”

Lesson 3

Now, a third lesson from this incident. I have
never heard them say it, but like all of us in
moments of suffering and pain, the Russells may
have sometimes shouted, “Why me? Why again?”
or “How much do we have to face in life?” or
“Does God really care about me?”
If they have asked those questions, they would
have been in good company. The Psalmist asked,
“How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord?” and
the Prophet Joseph Smith asked, “O God, where
art thou?” Even the Savior Himself, in the
excruciating ordeal of the Atonement, wondered if
He too had been forsaken. But the divine answer
to these faithful souls, to questions uttered in the
darkness of despair, is always and ever the same:
“Be still and know that I am God.” He has not
left us; we are not cast off; His promises are sure;
sanctified love is a constant: “The Lord of hosts is
with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.”
So, when you are being hammered on the anvil
of adversity, when your soul is being refined with
severe lessons that perhaps cannot be learned in
any other way, don’t cut and run. Don’t jump ship.
Don’t shake your fist at your bishop or your mission president or God. Please stay with the only
help and strength that can aid you in that painful
time. When you stumble in the race of life, don’t
crawl away from the very Physician who is unfailingly there to treat your injuries, lift you to your
feet, and help you finish the course.
We don’t know why all of the things that
happen to us in life happen, why sometimes
we are spared a tragedy and sometimes we are
not. But that is where faith must truly mean
something, or it is not faith at all. In such severe
circumstances, rare as we hope they are, we can
fall back on Alma’s reminder that faith and knowledge are related, but they are not synonymous.
In some matters you can have knowledge, even
perfect knowledge, but in some things, faith will
have to do until knowledge comes. And, as sweet
Sister Holland always tells the missionaries, faith
isn’t really faith if you have anything else to hold
on to.
What we need from everyone, from those of
you solidly in the Church as well as those struggling to hold on, is always the same: powerful
faith, faith that sustains us here and now, not just
on the day of judgment or somewhere in celestial glory. Most of us have faith in the ultimate,
long-term issues such as the truthfulness of The
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or
Christ’s Atonement and Resurrection. But sometimes we are less secure in pulling that faith
down to today, to this morning, to help with challenges in the near-term, such as Austen’s death
or Deedra’s automobile accident or your financial
troubles or disappointment in dating or asking
for a much-needed blessing regarding marriage
or health or some other personal need—prayers
that seem to go unanswered and unanswered and
unanswered. In these matters, too, you need faith,
as well as in ultimate things such as the truthfulness of this Church and the reality of Christ’s
Resurrection.
With this latter call for submissive and childlike faith in the near-term coming virtually every
day of our lives, my young friends, I welcome you
to the life that King Benjamin described and that
Jesus perfectly exemplified. Welcome to concepts
such as patience and long-suffering, which take
on meaning you never knew they had. Welcome
to not knowing but still believing. Welcome to
trusting in your Father in Heaven and believing
that all His promises, near-term or long-, will all
yet be kept in full. But beware, there can be some
anguish in this journey. That is because the road
from faith to pure knowledge, from mortal trials to celestial rewards, always somehow winds
through Gethsemane. And when we are invited
to join the Savior of the world in that place, we
should be prepared to answer the demanding
question He put to Peter, James, and John: “Could
ye not watch with me one hour?” Figuratively
speaking, our entire cycle of searching and waiting, of repentance and forgiveness, adds up to
much less than an hour compared to His bloodproducing purge of all the sorrows and all the sins
and all the mistakes made by all humankind from
Adam and Eve to the end of the world.
Please, you beautiful young colleagues in this
work: When your life seems to be one tear and
tragedy and heartache after another, the meaning
of which and the answers to which you cannot understand, I ask you as Alma did to “hope
for things which are not seen [but] which are
true.” As sure as you live, all of the blessings of
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, of Sarah, Rebekah, and
Rachel, are waiting for you, short-term, long-term,
and forever.
“A Refuge in Times of Trouble”
Well! Tragedies and submission. Heartache and
belief. Repentance and rainbows. Love and headon collisions. These are big boy and girl issues,
even seemingly contradictory issues at times. But I
promise you in the name of the Lord that help will
come and resolve those contradictions through
the cohesive power of the gospel of Jesus Christ—
what President John Taylor called the “cementing
and harmonizing influences" of eternal truth.
So, the Troy and Deedra Russells submit like
the young saints that they are. And they watch
the miracle of love and faith ripple out in everwidening circles to touch literally hundreds of
people—for example, the groups and groups of
people who have done the Russells’ laundry, those
who have brought in meals every day, those who
have taken the children to school, and those who
have stayed by Deedra’s bedside every day and
night that she has been in the St. George hospital. And remember that her family and friends
live in Henderson, Nevada. Love and faith have
helped Troy drive those miles and stay with his
bride fully one-half of those 132 days and nights.
His colleagues have doubled up at work to free
him for such attention. Meanwhile, two of his
patients have begun reading the Book of Mormon.
A close friend who over the years had refused
invitations to five different baptisms and a baby
blessing—vowing never to set foot in a Latter-day
Saint chapel—came to the sacrament meeting in
which Collin Russell spoke prior to leaving on his
mission. This friend thought that was the least he
could do for an absent mother lying in an intensive care unit miles away. And so, miracles flow
even from the mangled wreckage of a charcoalgray Honda and a white Silverado pickup—all in
response to childlike submission and meekness
when dealing with what the Father allows.
We appreciate Elder Holland letting us share our
testimonies with you all today. I know that we wish trials weren’t a part of our life, but one thing I’ve learned
these past few months, which have been really, really
hard for me, is that we have a very loving Heavenly
Father, and the reason He lets us go through these trials
is so that we can learn things about ourselves. We
can learn to have faith, and we can learn to be strong.
And especially we can learn to rely on our Savior.
Heavenly Father definitely sends us angels. He sent us
so many people to help us! He lets other people help us
during our lowest moments. I don’t think that I would
have had such a strong testimony of just how much
Heavenly Father really loves us if I hadn’t gone through
these things.
A few weeks after Austen passed away, a friend came
up to me and said that I had gone through the worst
thing that anyone could ever go through. I thought
about it for a minute, and I said, “I don’t agree with
you. I think the worst thing that any of us could ever
go through is to not be with our family for eternity.”
In these past four months there have been three or four
times when I didn’t know if she was going to make
it, but in the back of my mind I knew that even if she
didn’t, we had been sealed in the temple for time and all
eternity. And that was what really mattered. The only
thing I believe that we truly own is our ability to make
choices. Our bodies are a gift from God. The air we
breathe is a gift from God. All the material things can be
taken away at any time, but the one thing we have is our
agency. And what is so beautiful about the struggles and
trials and difficulties that we have is that they allow us
to use our agency: whether we can forgive or not forgive,
whether we can show love or kindness, or whether we
can help people. We hope you all know that we love our
Savior. We know that He died for us, and because of
Him we can be together as a family. We just hope that
we always use our agency to forgive others who have
wronged us, that we always show love and kindness, and
that we always are there for other people. And we leave
this with you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
My beloved young friends, I too leave my witness with you. I testify that when life brings you
disappointment or sorrow—and on occasion it
will—the gospel of Jesus Christ and the Church
that espouses the fullness of it are true and strong.
They are what the Psalmist called “a refuge for
the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.” I
bear witness of love and faith, of repentance and
perseverance, of long-suffering and the merciful grace of God. I particularly bear witness of
joy at the end of the quest, some of which comes
from the hard things we are called to do on that
quest. I testify that we are in the process of rebirth
and refinement, of becoming “a saint through
the atonement of Christ the Lord.” And we will
be reduced to childlike faith and humility in the
course of that experience. I testify of these truths
and leave an apostolic blessing on each of you for
the realization of every righteous desire of your
heart as you search for the God of heaven and
earth to be in your life. I willingly and lovingly
share with you my own faith in you and with you
and for you, lifting from you every burden that
you feel—the ones you can carry and the ones you
cannot—and healing every wound you fear now
is fatal. I do so with love in the name of Him who
gives the power to do such things, who Himself
was lifted up on a cross so we could be lifted up to
eternal life. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
